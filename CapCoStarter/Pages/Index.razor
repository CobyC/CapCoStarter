<h2>Simple Open Identity Connect Implementation</h2>
<p>
    This version is a simple OIDC setup including ASP.NET Core Identity, that can be used as a start point for apps making use of openid connect and ASP.Net Core Identity
</p>
<p>
    This is using the pluralsight courses from Kevin Dockx as guidance.
   <ul style="list-style: none;">
       <li><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/securing-aspnet-core-3-oauth2-openid-connect/table-of-contents">Securing ASP.NET Core 3 with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect</a></li>
       <li>and</li>

   </ul>
 </p>

<p>
    It uses the default ASP.Net Core data store (EF Core)
</p>

<p>
    The solution is structured:
    <ul>
        <li>Blazor Client Project (Main web site)</li>
        <li>Api - Project (backend Apis that access data)</li>
        <li>Open Id Connect, including ASPNET Core Identity - Project (used for authentication and autorization, user management, security token management) </li>
        <li>Shared - Project (contains shared dtos, classes used in above projects)</li>
    </ul>
